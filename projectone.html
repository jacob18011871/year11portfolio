        <p>My model (lets name him nutsach) is targetted towards teenagers who like to play games, and horror. Oh. Right, its also a bag of walnuts. 
          A spooky bag of walnuts... I left the model up to fate and it told me to make it a bag of walnuts! Anyway, really just targetting the younger side of teenagers which have a pretty specific sense of humor. Specifically men. 
           I dunno if everyone will enjoy a living bag of walnuts. Especially one which is meant to be scary. Still. Those who find this at least mildly entertaining, I think they'll like this..!!</p>

        <h1>Development</h1>
        <p>The very beginning of this divine configuration began in the early year of the dragon, the unstoppable expansion of my mind broke through the confines of an average human, thus I decided to begin creating a 3D low poly designed character.
        <h2>Task 1</h2>
        
        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>Following the instructions, piece by piece I built my design beginning off with the torso and limbs (guh)</p>

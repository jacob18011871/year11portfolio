        <p>My model (lets name him nutsach) is targetted towards teenagers who like to play games, and horror. Oh. Right, its also a bag of walnuts. 
          A spooky bag of walnuts... I left the model up to fate and it told me to make it a bag of walnuts! Anyway, really just targetting the younger side of teenagers which have a pretty specific sense of humor. Specifically men. 
           I dunno if everyone will enjoy a living bag of walnuts. Especially one which is meant to be scary. Still. Those who find this at least mildly entertaining, I think they'll like this..!!</p>
